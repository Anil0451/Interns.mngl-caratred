Fundamental Data Types

Four types of fundamental data types.
1.Int
2.float
3.bool
4.complex

--> INT : Int is one of the pre-defined class and it treated as Fundamental Data Type.The purpose of 'int' data type is that to store Integer / Integral / whole  
  Numbers.
 Example: ID Numbers, Adhar Card Numbers, Emp Numbers , PAN numbers.

 Ex: 
a=7
print(num,type(a))

a=5
print(_num,type(a))

a=15489763464613
print(num1,type(a))

a = 4632164
print(Num,type(a))

a_1=879456123
print(a_1,type(a_1))

 in int data type we have 4 types of Number Systems. They are 
  
1) Decimal Number System 
It is one of default Number System. The digits present in this number System are 
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9----toal 10 digits

2) Binary Number System 
The Digits present in this number system are  0,1--total digits- 2. The base for Binary Number System is 2 
Ex :  
a=0b100
print(a,type(a))

3) Octal Number System 
The Digits present in this number system are  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7   digits- 8 
The base for Octal Number System is 8 To store Octal Number System data in python Programming, Octal Number System data must starts or preceded with  0o or  0O.            

4) Hexa Decimal Number System 
 Ex:  
b=0o34
print(b, type(b))

--> FLOAT : float is used to allocate memory space for storing Numbers with a decimal point or numbers written in exponential form, e.g., 3.14 , -0.001 ).The float data type can also be used for storing / representing Scientific  
  Notation  of Numerical values and General format is Mantisa e Exponent 

  Ex: a=2.2
print(num,type(a))


a_1=5.5
print(_num,type(a_1))

a1=4.77532
print(num1,type(a1))

b = 6.456554129
print(Num,type(b))

b_1=5.83276
print(b_1,type(b_1))

--> BOOLEAN :Bool is one of the pre-defined class and treated as Fundamental data type. The purpose of bool data type is that "To store True and False Values (Known   	as Logical Values) "  Boolean is used to allocate memory space for storing boolean values. In general there are two types of boolean values: true, false.

Ex: c=True
print(num,type(c))


c_1=False
print(_num,type(c_1))

c1=True
print(num1,type(c1))

d = False
print(Num,type(d))

d_1=True
print(d_1,type(d_1))

--> COMPLEX :Complex is one of the pre-defined class and treated as Fundamental datatype. complex is used to allocate memory for storing compleax numbers, which contains real and imagenary parts.

Ex: e=1+9j
print(e,type(e))


e_1=i+5j
print(_num,type(e_1))

e1=6
print(e1,type(e1))

f = 8
print(f,type(f))

f_1=6
print(f_1,type(f_1))
